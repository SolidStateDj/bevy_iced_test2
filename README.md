This project relies on custom patches to `bevy_iced` in order to function. 

I don't know how to easily link it here, so I recommend cloning https://github.com/SolidStateDj/bevy_iced.git, and manually changing the `path` of the `bevy_iced` dependency in the `Cargo.toml` file to wherever you cloned it to.
